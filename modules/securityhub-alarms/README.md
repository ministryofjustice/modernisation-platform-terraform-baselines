Security Hub has dedicated controls which check that these alarms/metric filters exist to show our compliance with the benchmark. It should be noted that these controls have been [removed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark.html) for later versions of the benchmark (e.g. v3.0.0) if we decide to upgrade the security standards in future.

The module also generates some extra alarms that are of benefit to the Modernisation Platform team e.g. monitoring use of the Administrator role.
